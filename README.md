## Data Science Certifications 📊

This repository documents my learning journey through various Data Science certifications, documenting my journey from software engineer to a Data Scientist

All courses currently included are from Coursera, with plans to expand to other platforms in the future.

### 📁 Repository Overview

Each folder in this repository represents a separate professional certificate program or specialization. For example:

1. Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science
2. Maachine Learning Specialization
These may contain one or more courses related to the respective certificate.

### 📚 Folder Structure

Each certification folder follows the same internal structure:
