## Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Definition

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions, observes the resulting state and reward, and adjusts its behavior to maximize cumulative reward over time.

### 2. Core Components

- **Agent**
    
    The learner or decision-maker.
    
- **Environment**
    
    Everything the agent interacts with.
    
- **State (s)**
    
    A representation of the current situation.
    
- **Action (a)**
    
    A choice the agent can make in state s.
    
- **Reward (r)**
    
    A scalar signal received after taking an action.
    
- **Policy (π)**
    
    A mapping from states to action probabilities or choices.
    
- **Return (Gₜ)**
    
    The total (possibly discounted) reward from time t onward.
    

### 3. Markov Decision Process (MDP)

An RL problem is often formalized as an MDP defined by the tuple

```
(S, A, P, R, γ)
```

- `S`: set of states
- `A`: set of actions
- `P(s' | s, a)`: transition probability
- `R(s, a)`: expected immediate reward
- `γ`: discount factor in [0,1]

### 4. Discounted Return

For an episode of length T, the return at time t is

```
G_t = r_{t+1} + γ * r_{t+2} + γ^2 * r_{t+3} + … + γ^{T-t-1} * r_T
```

Discounting encourages earlier rewards and ensures convergence when T→∞.

### 5. Value Functions

- **State-Value Vπ(s)**
    
    Expected return starting from state s and following policy π:
    
    ```
    Vπ(s) = Eπ [ G_t | s_t = s ]
    ```
    
- **Action-Value Qπ(s, a)**
    
    Expected return after taking action a in state s and following π:
    
    ```
    Qπ(s,a) = Eπ [ G_t | s_t = s, a_t = a ]
    ```
    

### 6. Bellman Equations

Bellman expectation for Vπ:

```
Vπ(s) = ∑_a π(a|s) ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [ R(s,a) + γ Vπ(s') ]
```

Bellman optimality for V*:

```
V*(s) = max_a ∑_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [ R(s,a) + γ V*(s') ]
```

### 7. Dynamic Programming

Applicable when P and R are known.

- **Policy Evaluation**: compute Vπ for a fixed π
- **Policy Improvement**: update π to be greedy wrt Vπ
- **Policy Iteration**: alternate evaluation + improvement
- **Value Iteration**: directly update V* via Bellman optimality until convergence

### 8. Monte Carlo Methods

Learn Vπ or Qπ from complete episodes without needing P:

- **First-Visit MC**: average returns of first visits to each state
- **Every-Visit MC**: average returns of every visit

Requires episodes to terminate; high variance but unbiased.

### 9. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning

Combine Monte Carlo and DP ideas:

- **TD(0)** update for V(s):
    
    ```
    V(s) ← V(s) + α [ r_{t+1} + γ V(s_{t+1}) − V(s) ]
    ```
    
- **SARSA (On-Policy)** update for Q(s,a):
    
    ```
    Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α [ r + γ Q(s',a') − Q(s,a) ]
    ```
    
- **Q-Learning (Off-Policy)** update for Q:
    
    ```
    Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α [ r + γ max_{a'} Q(s',a') − Q(s,a) ]
    ```
    

### 10. Exploration vs. Exploitation

- **ε-Greedy**: with probability ε pick a random action, else greedy
- **Softmax / Boltzmann**: sample actions proportional to exp(Q/τ)
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**: balances mean reward and uncertainty

### 11. Function Approximation

For large or continuous state spaces, approximate V or Q by parameterized functions (linear or neural nets):

```python
V(s; w) ≈ wᵀ φ(s)         # linear
Q(s,a; θ) ≈ neural_net(s,a; θ)
```

Combine with TD updates to adjust parameters by gradient descent.

### 12. Deep Reinforcement Learning

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
    
    Use a neural network to approximate Q; train with experience replay and target network.
    
- **Double DQN**
    
    Reduces overestimation by decoupling action selection and evaluation.
    
- **Dueling DQN**
    
    Factorizes Q into state-value and advantage streams.
    

### 13. Policy Gradient Methods

Learn parameterized policy π(a|s; θ) directly:

```python
loss = − Eπ [ log π(a|s; θ) * G_t ]
```

- **REINFORCE**: Monte Carlo policy gradient.
- **Actor-Critic**: learn both policy (actor) and value (critic) to reduce variance.

### 14. Advanced Actor-Critic Algorithms

- **A2C / A3C**: synchronous / asynchronous parallel actors.
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**: for continuous actions with actor-critic.
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: stable updates via clipped objective.
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**: entropy-regularized RL for better exploration.

### 15. Model-Based vs. Model-Free

- **Model-Based RL**: learn or use known P and R to plan (e.g., Dyna, Monte Carlo Tree Search).
- **Model-Free RL**: learn policies or value functions from experience without explicit P.

### 16. Multi-Agent & Hierarchical RL

- **Multi-Agent**: multiple agents interacting, either cooperative or competitive (e.g., MADDPG).
- **Hierarchical RL**: high-level policy selects subgoals or options, low-level policies achieve them.

### 17. Safety, Ethics, and Practical Tips

- Clip rewards and gradients to avoid explosions.
- Use reward shaping carefully to guide learning.
- Monitor for overfitting to simulators.
- Evaluate sample efficiency and stability.

### 18. Tools & Ecosystem

- **OpenAI Gym**: benchmark environments.
- **Stable Baselines / RLlib / TensorFlow Agents**: high-level RL libraries.
- **Dopamine (Google)**: research framework for DQN variants.

### 19. Simple Q-Learning Example in Python

```python
import numpy as np

n_states, n_actions = 10, 4
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
alpha, gamma, epsilon = 0.1, 0.99, 0.1

for episode in range(1000):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = np.random.randint(n_actions)
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state])
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        td_target = reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state])
        td_error  = td_target - Q[state, action]
        Q[state, action] += alpha * td_error

        state = next_state
```

## Mars Rover Navigation: A Reinforcement Learning Example

### 1. Problem Setup

The goal is to train a Mars rover to autonomously navigate from a landing site to a designated science target, avoiding hazards and managing its energy.

We simulate the Martian terrain as a grid world where each cell encodes elevation, obstacle probability, and solar exposure. The rover senses its local surroundings, decides on a movement command, and receives feedback based on progress and safety.

### 2. MDP Formulation

State space (S):

- Rover’s (x, y) coordinates on the grid
- Local elevation map patch (e.g., 3×3 heights)
- Battery level ∈ [0, 1]
- Remaining mission time ∈ ℕ

Action space (A):

1. Move north, south, east, or west
2. Drill for sample
3. Pause to recharge via solar panels
4. Transmit status back to Earth

Transition probability P(s′|s,a) is derived from terrain difficulty and action stochasticity (e.g., a slip on sandy soil).

Reward function R(s, a):

- +10 for reaching the science target
- +2 for successfully drilling a soil sample
- –5 for collision or steep-slope failure
- –0.1 per time step (penalize slow progress)
- +0.5 per recharge action scaled by solar exposure

Discount factor γ = 0.99 to balance immediate goals and long‐term mission success.

### 3. Choice of Algorithm

For a discrete grid, tabular Q-learning can illustrate core RL concepts. For realistic continuous terrains and high‐dimensional sensor inputs, we switch to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Actor-Critic methods.

### 3.1 Tabular Q-Learning

- Pros: simple, transparent updates
- Cons: scales poorly with large state spaces

### 3.2 Deep Q-Network (DQN)

- Uses a neural network to approximate Q(s, a)
- Incorporates experience replay and target networks for stability

### 4. Simple Q-Learning Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

# Grid dimensions
width, height = 20, 20
n_states = width * height
n_actions = 6  # 4 moves + drill + recharge

# Initialize Q-table
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))

alpha = 0.1      # learning rate
gamma = 0.99     # discount factor
epsilon = 0.2    # exploration probability

def state_id(x, y):
    return y * width + x

def choose_action(s):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return np.random.randint(n_actions)
    return np.argmax(Q[s])

for episode in range(5000):
    x, y = landing_x, landing_y
    battery, time_left = 1.0, max_time
    done = False

    while not done:
        s = state_id(x, y)
        a = choose_action(s)

        # Simulate environment step
        x2, y2, reward, done = env_step(x, y, battery, time_left, a)
        s2 = state_id(x2, y2)

        # Q-Learning update
        td_target = reward + gamma * np.max(Q[s2])
        Q[s, a] += alpha * (td_target - Q[s, a])

        x, y = x2, y2
        battery *= env_battery_decay(a)
        time_left -= 1
```

### 5. Scaling Up with DQN

1. **Neural Network Architecture**
    - Convolutional layers for local elevation patch
    - Fully connected layers merging position, battery, time
2. **Experience Replay**
    - Store (s, a, r, s′, done) in a buffer
    - Sample minibatches to break correlations
3. **Target Network**
    - Clone main Q-network every N steps to stabilize learning
4. **Hyperparameters**
    - Learning rate 1e-4, batch size 32, replay buffer 50 000, update target every 1 000 steps

### 6. Practical Considerations

- Reward Shaping
    - Gradually increase penalty for unsafe actions to encourage exploration under controlled risk.
- Sample Efficiency
    - Pretrain in simpler simulated terrains, then fine-tune on complex maps.
- Safety Layers
    - Hard constraints that override actions risking collision or battery depletion.
- Sim-to-Real Transfer
    - Domain randomization on terrain textures, solar intensity, sensor noise.

## The Return in Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Intuition Behind the Return

The return is the single number that tells an agent how well it did from a given time onward.

It bundles all future rewards into one value so the agent can compare different actions or policies based on long-term outcomes.

### 2. Mathematical Definition

For an episode ending at time T, the discounted return at time t is

```
G_t = r_{t+1} + γ * r_{t+2} + γ^2 * r_{t+3} + … + γ^{T-t-1} * r_T
```

In the infinite-horizon (non-terminating) case, we write

```
G_t = sum_{k=0}^∞ γ^k * r_{t+k+1}
```

### 3. Discount Factor and Its Effects

The discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1] controls how much future rewards count:

- γ = 0 makes the agent myopic (only immediate reward matters)
- γ close to 1 makes the agent far-sighted (values long-term outcomes)
- Lower γ shortens the effective planning horizon and reduces variance

### 4. Episodic vs. Infinite-Horizon Returns

Episodic tasks have natural endpoints (T is finite) and use the full-episode return definition.

Infinite-horizon tasks assume the sum converges (γ < 1) so returns remain finite.

### 5. Variants of Return

### 5.1 Full (Monte-Carlo) Return

Uses the entire remainder of the episode. No bootstrapping. High variance, unbiased.

### 5.2 n-Step Return

Bootstraps after n steps:

```
G_t^{(n)} = r_{t+1} + γ * r_{t+2} + … + γ^{n-1} * r_{t+n} + γ^n * V(s_{t+n})
```

Balances bias (from bootstrapping) and variance (from sampling).

### 5.3 λ-Return (TD(λ))

Combines all n-step returns with exponential weighting by λ:

```
G_t^{λ} = (1 - λ) * sum_{n=1}^∞ λ^{n-1} * G_t^{(n)}
```

Smoothly interpolates between 1-step TD and full return.

### 5.4 Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)

A variant of λ-return applied to advantage calculation to reduce variance in policy gradients.

### 6. Connection to Value Functions

The return is the random variable whose expectation defines value functions:

```
V^π(s) = Eπ [ G_t | s_t = s ]
Q^π(s,a) = Eπ [ G_t | s_t = s, a_t = a ]
```

These expectations appear in Bellman equations and drive policy evaluation and improvement.

### 7. Role in Core Algorithms

### 7.1 Monte-Carlo Methods

Estimate V or Q by averaging observed full returns.

### 7.2 Temporal-Difference (TD) Methods

Use one-step return

```
r_{t+1} + γ * V(s_{t+1})
```

to bootstrap value estimates.

### 7.3 Q-Learning and SARSA

Use one-step return on Q:

```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α * [r + γ * max_{a'}Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

or on-policy update

```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α * [r + γ * Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
```

### 7.4 Policy Gradient Methods

Scale the policy gradient by the return or advantage:

```
∇θ J(θ) ≈ Eπ [ ∇θ log π(a|s;θ) * (G_t - baseline) ]
```

### 8. Bias–Variance Trade-Off

- Full returns: unbiased but high variance
- 1-step TD: lower variance but biased
- n-step or λ-returns: interpolate bias and variance
- Choosing γ, n, and λ is critical for stable and efficient learning

### 9. Practical Computation of Returns

```python
def compute_returns(rewards, gamma):
    returns = []
    G = 0
    for r in reversed(rewards):
        G = r + gamma * G
        returns.insert(0, G)
    return returns

# Example:
# rewards = [1, 0, -1, 2]
# gamma = 0.9
# returns = compute_returns(rewards, gamma)
```

### 10. Advanced Considerations

- Off-Policy Targets
    
    Use importance sampling to correct returns when learning off-policy.
    
- Multi-Step TD Targets
    
    Blend different n-step targets in replay buffers for improved stability.
    
- Prioritized Experience Replay
    
    Weight sampling by TD error magnitude, which depends on return targets.
    
- Reward Normalization and Clipping
    
    Scale or clip rewards to keep returns within a stable range.
    

### 11. Example Use Case and Code Snippet

Imagine training an agent to maximize cumulative clicks (reward) on a website. The return models lifetime user engagement. You can compute 5-step returns for faster updates while still capturing near-term engagement trends.

```python
# 5-step return example
def n_step_returns(rewards, gamma, n):
    returns = []
    T = len(rewards)
    for t in range(T):
        G = 0
        for k in range(n):
            if t+k < T:
                G += (gamma**k) * rewards[t+k]
            else:
                break
        if t+n < T:
            G += (gamma**n) * V_values[t+n]   # bootstrapped value
        returns.append(G)
    return returns
```

### 1. Intuition Behind a Policy

A policy is the decision-making rule an agent uses to choose actions given its current state.

It encapsulates the agent’s behavior: “In situation s, do action a.”

### 2. Formal Definition

A policy π is a mapping from states to actions or action distributions.

```
Deterministic: π(s) = a
Stochastic:    π(a | s) = probability of choosing a in state s
```

### 3. Types of Policies

### 3.1 Deterministic Policies

- Always select the same action in a given state.
- Easy to represent in small tables.

### 3.2 Stochastic Policies

- Define a probability distribution over actions for each state.
- Allow exploration and can model uncertainty.

### 4. Policy Representation

### 4.1 Tabular Policies

- Store π(s) or π(a | s) in a table of size |S| × |A|.
- Only feasible for small, discrete state-action spaces.

### 4.2 Parameterized Policies

- Use a function approximator π(a | s; θ) with parameters θ.
- Common choices:
    - Linear models: π(a|s;θ) = softmax(θᵀφ(s))
    - Neural networks producing action logits or mean/variance for continuous tasks

### 5. Policy Evaluation and Improvement

- **Evaluation**: estimate the value of a policy, Vπ(s) or Qπ(s,a).
- **Improvement**: derive a new policy π′ that is greedy or partially greedy with respect to the value estimates.

This leads to the policy improvement theorem: a policy that picks actions with higher Qπ values never performs worse.

### 6. Policy Iteration and Value Iteration

- **Policy Iteration**
    1. Policy evaluation: compute Vπ
    2. Policy improvement: π ← argmaxₐ Qπ(s,a)
    3. Repeat until convergence
- **Value Iteration**
    1. Directly update V(s) using the Bellman optimality operator
    2. Extract policy when values converge

### 7. Policy Gradient Methods

Rather than deriving π from Q or V, directly adjust θ to maximize expected return J(θ).

### 7.1 REINFORCE

```
θ ← θ + α * ∇θ log π(a_t | s_t; θ) * G_t
```

- Uses full-episode returns Gₜ
- High variance but straightforward

### 7.2 Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C)

```
δ_t = r_{t+1} + γ * V(s_{t+1}; w) - V(s_t; w)
θ ← θ + α_actor * ∇θ log π(a_t|s_t; θ) * δ_t
w ← w - α_critic * ∇_w δ_t^2
```

- δₜ is the TD error (advantage estimate)
- Simultaneously learns a value function to reduce variance

### 8. Actor-Critic Algorithms

### 8.1 On-Policy Actor-Critic

- Learn π and V under the current policy
- Examples: A2C, A3C

### 8.2 Off-Policy Actor-Critic

- Critic learns from a replay buffer of past experiences
- Actor can improve using off-policy corrections
- Examples:
    - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
    - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)

### 9. Exploration vs. Exploitation in Policy Design

### 9.1 ε-Greedy

- With probability ε choose a random action, otherwise greedy.

### 9.2 Softmax (Boltzmann)

```
π(a|s) = exp(Q(s,a)/τ) / sum_b exp(Q(s,b)/τ)
```

- Temperature τ controls randomness

### 9.3 Entropy Regularization

- Add an entropy bonus to the objective to encourage diverse actions
- Objective: J(θ) = E[ ... ] + β * H(π(·|s;θ))

### 10. Advanced Policy Optimization

### 10.1 Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)

- Constrain each policy update to be close to the old policy
- Enforce KL-divergence limit per update

### 10.2 Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

- Simplifies TRPO with a clipped surrogate objective

```
L_CLIP(θ) = E[ min(
    ρ_t(θ) * A_t,
    clip(ρ_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε) * A_t
)]
```

- ρₜ(θ) = π(a_t|s_t;θ) / π(a_t|s_t;θ_old)

### 11. Practical Considerations

- Choose policy parameterization to match action space
- Tune entropy or ε to balance exploration
- Regularize policies (e.g., weight decay, dropout)
- Monitor policy divergence and update size

### 12. Code Snippets

### 12.1 Tabular ε-Greedy Policy Update

```python
def epsilon_greedy(Q, state, epsilon):
    if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
        return np.random.randint(len(Q[state]))
    return np.argmax(Q[state])
```

### 12.2 Neural Network Policy in PyTorch

```python
class PolicyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, action_dim),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)

# Sample action
probs = policy_net(state_tensor)
m = Categorical(probs)
action = m.sample()
log_prob = m.log_prob(action)
```

## State-Action Value Function in Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Intuition

The state-action value function tells you how good it is to take a particular action in a given state under a policy.

It lets the agent compare actions by estimating the total future reward if it starts from state s, takes action a, and then follows policy π.

### 2. Formal Definition

In code block form, the state-action value for policy π is defined as:

```
Q_pi(s, a) = E_pi [ G_t | s_t = s, a_t = a ]
```

where G_t is the discounted return from time t onward.

### 3. Connection to Return

Since G_t sums future rewards:

```
G_t = r_{t+1} + gamma * r_{t+2} + gamma^2 * r_{t+3} + …
```

we can view Q_pi(s,a) as the expected value of that sum when the first action is a.

### 4. Bellman Expectation Equation for Q

Q_pi satisfies the recursive relationship:

```
Q_pi(s, a) = E [ r_{t+1} + gamma * sum_{a'} pi(a'|s') * Q_pi(s', a')
               | s_t = s, a_t = a ]
```

This breaks the long-term estimate into immediate reward plus the expected value of the next step.

### 5. Bellman Optimality Equation for Q*

For the optimal policy, Q* obeys:

```
Q_star(s, a) = E [ r_{t+1} + gamma * max_{a'} Q_star(s', a')
                   | s_t = s, a_t = a ]
```

This equation underlies most off-policy control methods.

### 6. Policy Evaluation Using Q

To evaluate a fixed policy π, you can iteratively apply the Bellman expectation update:

```
Q(s,a) <- sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) [ R(s,a) + gamma * sum_{a'} pi(a'|s') * Q(s',a') ]
```

until the values converge.

### 7. Learning Q via Monte Carlo

Estimate Q_pi by averaging sampled returns:

```python
# for each (s, a) in an episode
Q[s,a] = average of all returns following first visits to (s,a)
```

No bootstrapping—unbiased but high variance and needs episode termination.

### 8. Learning Q via Temporal-Difference

Use one-step bootstrap targets:

```
target = r_{t+1} + gamma * Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})
Q(s_t, a_t) <- Q(s_t, a_t) + alpha * (target - Q(s_t, a_t))
```

This reduces variance and can learn online.

### 9. Off-Policy Q-Learning

Q-Learning uses the optimality Bellman equation target:

```
target = r_{t+1} + gamma * max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a')
Q(s_t, a_t) <- Q(s_t, a_t) + alpha * (target - Q(s_t, a_t))

```

It learns the optimal Q* regardless of the behavior policy.

### 10. On-Policy SARSA

SARSA uses the next action from the current policy:

```
target = r_{t+1} + gamma * Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})
Q(s_t, a_t) <- Q(s_t, a_t) + alpha * (target - Q(s_t, a_t))
```

It learns Q_pi for the policy that actually generated the data.

### 11. Function Approximation for Q

For large or continuous spaces, represent Q(s,a; θ) with parameters θ:

- Linear: Q(s,a; w) = wᵀ φ(s,a)
- Nonlinear: Q(s,a; θ) via neural networks

Update θ by gradient descent on the TD error.

### 12. Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

Key components:

- Experience replay buffer of (s,a,r,s')
- Mini-batch TD updates with target network
- Loss:
    
    ```
    L(θ) = E_{batch} [ (r + gamma * max_{a'} Q(s',a'; θ_target) - Q(s,a; θ))^2 ]
    ```
    

### 13. Use of Q in Actor-Critic Methods

The critic often estimates Q(s,a) or V(s) to compute advantages:

```
A_t = Q(s_t, a_t) - V(s_t)
```

which the actor uses to scale policy gradients.

### 14. Exploration and Q Estimates

- ε-Greedy uses Q(s,a) to choose mostly high-value actions.
- Upper Confidence Bound balances Q(s,a) and uncertainty.

Proper exploration ensures accurate Q estimates.

### 15. Convergence Guarantees

- Tabular Q-Learning converges to Q* under standard conditions (decaying alpha, sufficient exploration).
- Function approximation breaks guarantees—requires careful tuning and stability tricks.

### 16. Practical Code Snippet

```python
import numpy as np

# Q-table initialization
Q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))
alpha, gamma, epsilon = 0.1, 0.99, 0.1

for episode in range(max_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False

    while not done:
        # ε-greedy action
        if np.random.rand() < epsilon:
            action = np.random.randint(n_actions)
        else:
            action = np.argmax(Q[state])

        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)

        # Q-Learning update
        target = reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state])
        Q[state, action] += alpha * (target - Q[state, action])

        state = next_state
```

## Bellman Equation in Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Intuition and Role

The Bellman equation expresses the value of a state (or state-action pair) in terms of immediate reward plus the discounted value of successor states.

It provides a recursive decomposition that makes planning and learning tractable by breaking down a long-horizon return into one-step “backups.”

### 2. Markov Decision Process Recap

A Markov Decision Process is defined by the tuple

```
(S, A, P, R, γ)
```

where

- S is the set of states
- A is the set of actions
- P(s' | s, a) is the transition probability
- R(s, a) is the expected immediate reward
- γ ∈ [0, 1] is the discount factor

### 3. Bellman Expectation Equation

For a fixed policy π, the state-value function Vπ satisfies:

```
Vπ(s) = sum_{a} π(a|s) * [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * Vπ(s') ]
```

This equation holds for every state s and defines Vπ as the unique solution to a system of linear equations.

### 4. Bellman Optimality Equation

The optimal state-value function V* obeys:

```
V*(s) = max_{a} [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * V*(s') ]
```

This non-linear equation characterizes the best possible value achievable from state s under any policy.

### 5. Bellman Equations for Action-Value Functions

### 5.1 Expectation Form for Qπ

```
Qπ(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * sum_{a'} π(a'|s') * Qπ(s',a')
```

### 5.2 Optimality Form for Q*

```
Q*(s,a) = R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * max_{a'} Q*(s',a')
```

These define how Q functions back up through the MDP.

### 6. Bellman Backup Operator

Define the Bellman optimality operator 𝒯 as:

```
(𝒯 V)(s) = max_{a} [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * V(s') ]
```

Properties:

- 𝒯 is a γ-contraction in the sup-norm
- Repeated application converges to V* (unique fixed point)

### 7. Dynamic Programming with Bellman Equations

### 7.1 Policy Evaluation

Iteratively apply the expectation Bellman update:

```
V_{k+1}(s) = sum_{a} π(a|s) * [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * V_k(s') ]
```

until V converges.

### 7.2 Policy Improvement

Given Vπ, derive an improved policy:

```
π'(s) = argmax_{a} [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * Vπ(s') ]
```

### 7.3 Policy Iteration

1. Initialize π
2. Policy Evaluation until Vπ stabilizes
3. Policy Improvement to get π'
4. Repeat until π converges

### 7.4 Value Iteration

Combine evaluation and improvement in one backup:

```
V_{k+1}(s) = max_{a} [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * V_k(s') ]
```

until V converges, then extract π*.

### 8. Extensions and Variants

### 8.1 Asynchronous Updates & Prioritized Sweeping

- Update states in any order (asynchronous DP)
- Prioritize states with largest Bellman error for speed

### 8.2 n-Step and λ-Bellman Equations

Generalize single-step backups to multi-step returns:

```
G_t^{(n)} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} γ^k r_{t+k+1} + γ^n V(s_{t+n})
```

Combine via λ-return to interpolate:

```
G_t^{λ} = (1 - λ) * sum_{n=1}^∞ λ^{n-1} G_t^{(n)}
```

### 8.3 Continuous-State Bellman Integral Equation

Replace sums with integrals for continuous spaces:

```
V(s) = max_{a} [ R(s,a) + γ * ∫ P(s'|s,a) V(s') ds' ]

```

### 9. Approximate Bellman Equations

### 9.1 Bellman Error and Residual

Define Bellman residual for approximate V̂:

```
δ(s) = V̂(s) - [ R(s,a) + γ * sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) * V̂(s') ]
```

### 9.2 Fitted Value Iteration

Use supervised regression to fit V̂ to Bellman targets from a dataset of transitions.

### 9.3 Projected Bellman Error

Minimize ‖V̂ – 𝒫𝒯 V̂‖ where 𝒫 projects onto the function space, leading to Least-Squares TD.

### 10. Bellman Equation in Temporal-Difference and Q-Learning

### 10.1 TD(0) Target

```
target = r_{t+1} + γ * V(s_{t+1})
V(s_t) ← V(s_t) + α [target - V(s_t)]
```

### 10.2 Q-Learning Update

```
target = r_{t+1} + γ * max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a')
Q(s_t,a_t) ← Q(s_t,a_t) + α [target - Q(s_t,a_t)]
```

### 10.3 Deep Q-Network (DQN) Target

```
y = r + γ * max_{a'} Q(s', a'; θ_target)
loss = (y - Q(s,a; θ))^2
```

### 10.4 Double & Distributional Variants

- Double DQN uses two networks to reduce overestimation
- Distributional Bellman explores the full return distribution via categorical or quantile targets

### 11. Convergence Properties

- Exact DP operators converge geometrically to the unique fixed point V* or Q*
- TD and Q-Learning converge under diminishing α and sufficient exploration (tabular case)
- Function approximation may break guarantees; stability often requires target networks or projections

### 12. Practical Code Examples

### 12.1 Policy Evaluation Loop

```python
for _ in range(num_iterations):
    for s in states:
        V[s] = sum_a π[a][s] * (R[s][a] + γ * sum_s' P[s][a][s'] * V[s'])
```

### 12.2 Value Iteration

```python
while delta > tol:
    delta = 0
    for s in states:
        v_old = V[s]
        V[s] = max_a (R[s][a] + γ * sum_s' P[s][a][s'] * V[s'])
        delta = max(delta, abs(v_old - V[s]))
```

## Continuous State Space Applications in Reinforcement Learning

### 1. Definition and Motivation

Reinforcement learning with continuous state spaces means each state is represented by one or more real-valued variables instead of a finite set of discrete symbols.

This setting better models real-world systems—robot position and velocity, joint angles, temperature, market indicators—where discretizing can lose crucial information or explode the state count.

### 2. Challenges of Continuous State Spaces

- **Infinite or very large state sets** prevent tabular methods.
- **Function approximation** is required to generalize value or policy estimates across similar states.
- **Stability and convergence** issues arise when combining TD updates with nonlinear approximators.
- **Exploration** must consider smooth transitions rather than isolated discrete jumps.

### 3. Algorithmic Approaches

1. Function Approximators
    - Linear basis expansions: radial basis functions, tile coding
    - Neural networks: multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional nets
2. Off-Policy Value-Based
    - Deep Q-Networks with continuous states and discrete actions
    - Extensions like Double DQN and Dueling DQN
3. Policy Gradient and Actor-Critic
    - Vanilla Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
    - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for continuous actions
    - Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with entropy regularization
    - Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) balancing stability and performance
4. Model-Based Control
    - Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and LQG for linear dynamics
    - PILCO and probabilistic dynamics models for sample efficiency

### 4. Classic Benchmark Environments

- **Pendulum-v0**
    - State: angle and angular velocity (continuous)
    - Action: continuous torque
- **MountainCarContinuous-v0**
    - State: position, velocity
    - Action: continuous throttle
- **CarRacing-v0**
    - State: pixel image frames (continuous observation space)
    - Action: steering, acceleration, brake (continuous)
- **MuJoCo Suite (e.g., Hopper, Walker2d, Ant)**
    - State: joint angles, velocities, contacts
    - Action: torque commands per joint

### 5. Real-World Continuous Control Examples

- **Robotic Manipulation**
    - Gripper control using end-effector positions, joint torques
    - Learning pick-and-place with SAC or PPO
- **Autonomous Driving**
    - Steering angle, acceleration as continuous actions
    - State from LiDAR, camera embeddings, vehicle speed
- **Industrial Process Control**
    - Chemical reactor temperature and pressure regulation
    - PID controllers augmented with RL fine-tuning
- **Financial Portfolio Management**
    - State: asset prices, indicators, portfolio weights
    - Action: continuous weight adjustments across assets
- **Energy Management**
    - Smart grid battery charge/discharge rates
    - HVAC system temperature setpoints

### 6. Model-Based vs. Model-Free in Continuous Domains

- **Model-Free**
    - Relies solely on sampled transitions
    - Algorithms: DDPG, SAC, PPO
- **Model-Based**
    - Learns or uses known dynamics model
    - Algorithms: LQR, iterative LQR, PILCO
    - Can achieve higher sample efficiency but sensitive to model errors

### 7. Practical Code Snippets

### 7.1 Environment Setup

```python
import gym

# Pendulum example
env = gym.make('Pendulum-v0')
state = env.reset()
print('State dimension:', env.observation_space.shape)
print('Action dimension:', env.action_space.shape)
```

### 7.2 Simple DDPG Agent Skeleton

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class Actor(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(400, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(300, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(action_dim, activation='tanh')
        ])
    def call(self, state):
        return self.net(state)

class Critic(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(400, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(300, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
        ])
    def call(self, state, action):
        x = tf.concat([state, action], axis=-1)
        return self.net(x)
```

### 7.3 Soft Actor-Critic Update Target

```python
# target Q-value computation
next_action, logp_next = actor(next_state)
target_q1 = target_critic1(next_state, next_action)
target_q2 = target_critic2(next_state, next_action)
target_q = tf.minimum(target_q1, target_q2)
y = reward + gamma * (target_q - alpha * logp_next)
```

## Continuous State Space: Lunar Lander

### 1. Problem Overview

The Lunar Lander task challenges an agent to control a lander module and achieve a soft touchdown on a designated pad.

It features continuous observations of position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity, and a continuous action space of engine thrusts.

This environment exemplifies how RL handles high-dimensional, continuous dynamics and safety-critical constraints.

### 2. Environment Setup

Install OpenAI Gym and import the continuous version:

```bash
pip install gym[box2d]
```

```python
import gym

env = gym.make('LunarLanderContinuous-v2')
state = env.reset()
print(env.observation_space, env.action_space)
```

### 3. State and Action Spaces

- Observation (`state`): 8-dimensional float vector
    1. x-coordinate of the lander
    2. y-coordinate of the lander
    3. x-velocity
    4. y-velocity
    5. lander angle
    6. angular velocity
    7. left leg contact flag (0 or 1)
    8. right leg contact flag (0 or 1)
- Action: 2-dimensional float vector
    
    ```
    [main_engine_thrust, side_engine_thrust]
    ```
    
    - main thrust ∈ [−1, +1]
    - side thrust ∈ [−1, +1]

### 4. Reward Function Details

Rewards guide the agent toward a smooth landing and penalize crashes or wasting fuel.

```
r = horizontal_distance_reward
  + vertical_distance_reward
  + angle_reward
  - (fuel_cost = 0.3 * |main_thrust|)
  - (fuel_cost = 0.03 * |side_thrust|)
  + (landing_bonus = +100 if both legs contact ground)
  - (crash_penalty = -100 if lander crashes)
```

### 5. Algorithm Selection

For continuous actions, popular choices are:

- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**
- **Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)**
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

Each balances exploration, stability, and sample efficiency differently.

### 6. Neural Network Architectures

### 6.1 Actor Network (Policy)

```python
# maps state → action mean
Actor:
  Input: state (8,)
  Dense(256, activation='relu')
  Dense(256, activation='relu')
  Dense(2, activation='tanh')  # outputs in [-1, 1]
```

### 6.2 Critic Network (Q-value)

```python
# maps state, action → Q-value
Critic:
  Input: concat(state, action) (10,)
  Dense(256, activation='relu')
  Dense(256, activation='relu')
  Dense(1, activation=None)
```

### 7. Training Pipeline

1. **Replay Buffer**: store transitions `(s, a, r, s', done)`.
2. **Sampling**: random minibatch of size `N` from buffer.
3. **Critic Update**: minimize bellman error
    
    ```
    target_q = r + γ * Q_target(s', actor_target(s')) * (1 - done)
    loss_critic = MSE(Q(s,a), target_q)
    ```
    
4. **Actor Update**: ascend on critic’s gradient
    
    ```
    loss_actor = -mean(Q(s, actor(s)))
    ```
    
5. **Target Networks**: soft update
    
    ```
    θ_target ← τ * θ + (1 - τ) * θ_target
    ```
    
6. **Repeat** until performance plateaus.

### 8. Evaluation Metrics

- **Episode Return**: total reward per episode.
- **Landing Success Rate**: fraction of episodes with safe landing.
- **Average Fuel Usage**: mean thrust magnitude.
- **Learning Curve**: return vs. training steps.

### 9. Practical Tips & Tricks

- Clip actions to `[-1, 1]`.
- Normalize state inputs (zero mean, unit variance).
- Use reward scaling or clipping to stabilize training.
- Tune `γ` (0.99–0.999) for horizon length.
- Adjust exploration noise (Ornstein–Uhlenbeck or Gaussian).
- Monitor for “hovering” behaviors that waste fuel.

## Learning the State-Value Function (V)

### Direct Answer

You learn the state-value function by approximating V(s) with a parameterized function (e.g., a neural network) and minimizing the Bellman error through Temporal-Difference updates or Monte Carlo targets.

### 1. Conceptual Foundations

### 1.1 What Is V(s)?

The state-value function V(s) gives the expected return starting from state s and following policy π:

[ V^\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}*\pi\Bigl[\sum*{t=0}^\infty \gamma^t r_{t+1},\Big|,s_0 = s\Bigr]. ]

### 1.2 Bellman Expectation Equation

Under π, V satisfies

[ V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{s',r} p(s',r\mid s,a)\bigl[r + \gamma,V^\pi(s')\bigr]. ]

In continuous or unknown dynamics, we replace the expectation with samples and optimize a parameterized V_θ.

### 2. Algorithms for Continuous State Spaces

| Algorithm | Update Target | Bias–Variance | On-Policy? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monte Carlo | (G_t = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k r_{t+k+1}) | low bias, high variance | yes |
| TD(0) | (r_{t+1} + \gamma,V(s_{t+1})) | moderate bias, low variance | yes |
| TD(λ) | λ-weighted multi-step returns | tunable bias–variance | yes |
| Fitted Value Iteration | batch regression on targets | batch, stable | off-policy |

### 3. Function Approximation with Neural Networks

### 3.1 Network Architecture

```python
import tensorflow as tf

class ValueNetwork(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden1 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.hidden2 = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.value   = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation=None)

    def call(self, state):
        x = self.hidden1(state)
        x = self.hidden2(x)
        return tf.squeeze(self.value(x), axis=1)  # shape: (batch,)
```

### 3.2 Loss & Update Rule

For a batch of transitions ((s, r, s', \mathit{done})), define the TD-target:

[ y = r + \gamma,(1 - \mathit{done}),V_\theta(s'). ]

Then minimize the mean squared error:

[ \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i \bigl[V_\theta(s_i) - y_i\bigr]^2. ]

### 4. TensorFlow Training Loop

```python
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=3e-4)
gamma = 0.99

@tf.function
def train_step(states, rewards, next_states, dones):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        v_current = value_net(states)
        v_next    = value_net(next_states)
        targets   = rewards + gamma * (1 - dones) * v_next
        loss      = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(v_current - targets))
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, value_net.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, value_net.trainable_variables))
    return loss
```

1. Collect a minibatch from your replay buffer or on-policy rollout.
2. Call `train_step(states, rewards, next_states, dones)` each gradient update.
3. Repeat until convergence.

### 5. Practical Tips & Tricks

- Normalize state inputs (zero mean, unit variance) for stable gradients.
- Clip TD-targets or use Huber loss to reduce the impact of outliers.
- If using off-policy data, incorporate importance sampling or use batch methods (Fitted Value Iteration).
- Experiment with λ in TD(λ) to balance bias and variance.

## Algorithm Refinement: Improved Neural Network Architecture

### Summary of Improvements

To elevate value‐function approximation, we’ll move from a simple feed-forward net to a modular, stability-focused, and expressive architecture featuring:

- Residual blocks with layer normalization
- Modern activations (e.g., Swish)
- Distributional or ensemble heads for uncertainty
- Spectral normalization for Lipschitz control
- Orthogonal weight initialization

### 1. Architectural Blueprint

### 1.1 Shared Feature Trunk

- Input → Dense(256, activation=Swish)
- LayerNorm
- Residual Block × 3
    - Each block:
        - Dense(256, activation=Swish)
        - LayerNorm
        - Dense(256, activation=None)
        - LayerNorm
        - Skip connection & Swish

### 1.2 Head Variants

| Head Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Single-Value Head | Standard V(s) scalar output |
| Ensemble Heads | K parallel value estimates → mean & variance |
| Distributional Head | Categorical logits over return atoms |

### 2. Code Example: Functional API

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, LayerNormalization, Add, Activation
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import tensorflow_probability as tfp

def swish(x):
    return tf.nn.swish(x)

def residual_block(x, units=256):
    shortcut = x
    out = Dense(units, kernel_initializer='orthogonal')(x)
    out = LayerNormalization()(out)
    out = Activation(swish)(out)
    out = Dense(units, kernel_initializer='orthogonal')(out)
    out = LayerNormalization()(out)
    out = Add()([shortcut, out])
    return Activation(swish)(out)

def build_value_network(state_dim, dist_atoms=51, ensemble_size=5):
    inputs = Input(shape=(state_dim,))
    x = Dense(256, kernel_initializer='orthogonal')(inputs)
    x = LayerNormalization()(x)
    x = Activation(swish)(x)

    # Shared trunk
    for _ in range(3):
        x = residual_block(x, units=256)

    # Single-value head
    v_head = Dense(1, kernel_initializer='orthogonal', name='v_single')(x)

    # Ensemble head
    ensemble_heads = [
        Dense(1, kernel_initializer='orthogonal', name=f'v_ens_{i}')(x)
        for i in range(ensemble_size)
    ]

    # Distributional head (C51 style)
    dist_head = Dense(dist_atoms, kernel_initializer='orthogonal', name='v_dist')(x)
    dist_head = tf.nn.log_softmax(dist_head, axis=-1)

    return Model(inputs=inputs,
                 outputs=[v_head, tf.concat(ensemble_heads, axis=1), dist_head],
                 name='ImprovedValueNet')
```

### 3. Training & Losses

- **Single-Value Loss**: Huber between V(s) and TD-target
- **Ensemble Loss**: average Huber over each head
- **Distributional Loss**: cross-entropy against projected Bellman distribution

```python
huber = tf.keras.losses.Huber()
ce     = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)

# Example for single head
loss_v = huber(v_pred, td_target)

# Ensemble
loss_ens = tf.reduce_mean([huber(ens[:,i], td_target) for i in range(ensemble_size)])

# Distributional
dist_target = project_distribution(rewards, next_dist, gamma)
loss_dist = ce(dist_target, dist_logits)
```

### 4. Practical Hyperparameters & Tips

- Learning rate: 3e-4
- Weight decay: 1e-5 on dense kernels
- Spectral normalization on critical layers if oscillations occur
- Batch size: 128–256
- Gradient clipping norm: 0.5
- Monitor head disagreement (ensemble std) to detect overconfidence

## Algorithm Refinement: Epsilon-Greedy Policy

### 1. Direct Answer

You refine an ε-greedy policy by crafting a dynamic ε schedule (linear, exponential, inverse-time), making ε state-dependent via visitation counts or uncertainty estimates, and blending in adaptive mechanisms to smoothly shift from exploration to exploitation.

### 2. Epsilon-Greedy: Core Definition

- At state s, draw u ∼ Uniform(0, 1).
- If u < ε: select a random action a ∼ Uniform(A).
- Else: select the greedy action a = argmaxₐ Q(s,a).

This simple scheme needs a well‐designed ε schedule to avoid premature convergence or wasted exploration.

### 3. Epsilon Decay Schedules

| Schedule | Formula | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linear Decay | εₜ = max(ε_min, ε₀ – k·t) | Steady, predictable drop |
| Exponential Decay | εₜ = ε₀·exp(–decay·t) | Fast early decay, long tail |
| Inverse Time | εₜ = ε₀ / (1 + decay·t) | Gradual decay, heavy early exploration |
- ε₀: initial exploration rate (e.g., 1.0)
- ε_min: lower bound (e.g., 0.01)
- decay, k: hyperparameters tuned via validation

### 4. State-Dependent & Adaptive ε

1. **Visitation‐Count Decay**
    
    ε(s) = ε_min + (ε_max – ε_min) / (1 + N(s))
    
    where N(s) tracks how often state s has been visited.
    
2. **Uncertainty-Driven ε**
    
    Leverage ensemble stddev or distributional variance:
    
    ```
    ε(s) = clip(α · stddev_Q(s), ε_min, ε_max)
    ```
    
    Promotes exploration where Q estimates disagree most.
    
3. **Reward-Sensitivity**
    
    Increase ε if recent returns stagnate; decrease when performance steadily improves.
    

### 5. Code Example: Epsilon Scheduler + Action Selection

```python
import numpy as np

class EpsilonScheduler:
    def __init__(self, eps0=1.0, eps_min=0.01, decay_type='linear', decay_rate=1e-4):
        self.eps0, self.eps_min = eps0, eps_min
        self.decay_type, self.decay_rate = decay_type, decay_rate
        self.step = 0

    def value(self):
        t = self.step
        if self.decay_type == 'linear':

### 6. Practical Tips & Tricks

- Always enforce ε ≥ ε_min to retain minimal exploration.
- Log ε over episodes to correlate exploration rate with learning curves.
- For continuous-action algorithms, replace ε-greedy with action-noise schedules (Gaussian or OU noise) using the same decay principles.
- Combine state-dependent ε with prioritized experience replay to target uncertain transitions.
- Tune decay hyperparameters using short, representative validation runs.

In each domain, RL systems increasingly combine offline data and simulation with online fine-tuning to accelerate training and lower safety risks.

### 4. Key Challenges

- Sample Efficiency: Reducing millions of environment interactions via better off-policy methods and model-based rollouts.
- Safety and Robustness: Enforcing safe exploration through constrained RL, shielding, and formal verification.
- Scalability: Handling multi-agent settings and high-dimensional continuous spaces.
- Interpretability: Explaining policies and value estimates for regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust.
- Ethical Considerations: Mitigating bias, ensuring fairness, and preserving privacy in reward design and data collection.

### 5. Emerging Trends

- Offline Reinforcement Learning: Learning from logged datasets without further environment interaction, crucial for healthcare and finance.
- Meta-Reinforcement Learning: Rapid adaptation to new tasks via learned inductive biases.
- Hierarchical RL: Decomposing tasks into subgoals to improve long-horizon performance.
- Sim2Real Transfer: Domain randomization and adaptation techniques that bridge simulation to real-world deployment.
- Multi-Objective RL: Balancing competing objectives such as performance, safety, and energy consumption.

### 6. Future Outlook

Many experts believe reinforcement learning will be pivotal for next-generation AI systems, potentially contributing to artificial general intelligence by enabling adaptive, goal-driven agents that learn from sparse and delayed feedback.

Continued progress hinges on better algorithms for efficiency and safety, standardized benchmarks for real-world tasks, and interdisciplinary collaboration between ML researchers, domain experts, and ethicists.
